### **3. Step-by-Step Setup**

#### **Infrastructure Setup**
1. **Azure Resource Group**:
   ```bash
   az group create --name MultiProjectRG --location eastus
   ```

2. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**:
   ```bash
   az aks create --resource-group MultiProjectRG --name MultiProjectAKS --node-count 5 --generate-ssh-keys
   ```

3. **VM and VMSS**:
   ```bash
   az vm create --resource-group MultiProjectRG --name MultiProjectVM --image UbuntuLTS --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys
   az vmss create --resource-group MultiProjectRG --name MultiProjectVMSS --image UbuntuLTS --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys
   ```

4. **Dynamic Provisioning with Terraform**:
   - Define resources in a Terraform configuration file:
     ```hcl
     provider "azurerm" {
       features {}
     }

     resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
       name     = "MultiProjectRG"
       location = "East US"
     }
     ```
   - Initialize and apply:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform apply
     ```

#### **Microservices Deployment**
1. **Dockerize Services**:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:16
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   RUN npm install
   CMD ["node", "service.js"]
   ```

2. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   - Define Kubernetes deployment configuration:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: orchestrator
     spec:
       replicas: 3
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: orchestrator
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: orchestrator
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: orchestrator
             image: myregistry/orchestrator:latest
             ports:
             - containerPort: 8080
     ```
   - Apply the deployment:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     ```

### **4. Task Splitting and Distribution**

#### **Logic for Task Splitting**
1. **Dynamic Decomposition Algorithm**:
   - Use recursive functions to break down tasks:
     ```python
     def split_task(task):
         if task.is_simple():
             return [task]
         return task.split_into_subtasks()
     ```

2. **Queue-Based Distribution**:
   - Employ RabbitMQ for managing task queues:
     ```javascript
     const amqp = require('amqplib');
     async function enqueueTask(task) {
         const connection = await amqp.connect('amqp://localhost');
         const channel = await connection.createChannel();
         await channel.assertQueue('tasks');
         channel.sendToQueue('tasks', Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(task)));
     }
     ```

#### **Resource Allocation and Priority Handling**
- Implement dynamic priority adjustment based on dependencies and deadlines.
- Use predictive AI models to estimate task completion times.
- Apply resource scheduling algorithms to minimize bottlenecks and ensure efficient load balancing.

### **5. Advanced Visualization for Task Management**

#### **Dynamic and Interactive Visualizations**
1. **Real-Time Diagrams with D3.js**:
   ```javascript
   const data = { nodes: [...], links: [...] };
   const svg = d3.select("svg");
   const simulation = d3.forceSimulation(data.nodes)
       .force("link", d3.forceLink(data.links).id(d => d.id))
       .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody())
       .force("center", d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2));
   ```

2. **Static Workflow Charts with Mermaid.js**:
   ```markdown
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Task A] --> B[Task B]
       B --> C[Task C]
       C --> D[Complete]
   ```
   ```

#### **Integrated Dashboards**
- Provide task hierarchy and real-time status updates via an intuitive UI.
- Integrate project timelines using Gantt charts.
- Enable users to dynamically filter and rearrange task views for personalized monitoring.

   ```
2. Aggregate logs from all microservices for centralized analysis.
3. Use custom log parsers to extract actionable insights and streamline troubleshooting workflows.
