     def predict_errors(log_data):
         model = RandomForestClassifier()
         model.fit(log_data['features'], log_data['labels'])
         predictions = model.predict(log_data['new_data'])
         return predictions
     ```
   - **Enhanced Use Case**: A global logistics platform implemented predictive error models within CI/CD workflows, achieving a 70% reduction in post-deployment failures. Automated alerts enabled faster developer response times.

2. **Automated Issue Triage**:
   - Design Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems for issue classification and prioritization based on severity and resolution urgency. Incorporating attention-based transformer models can improve contextual understanding of issue descriptions.

     def classify_issue(description):
         response = openai.Completion.create(
             model="gpt-4",
             prompt=f"Classify this issue: {description}",
             max_tokens=50
         )
         return response['choices'][0]['text']
     ```
   - **Industry Example**: A fintech firm used NLP-powered triage systems to categorize tickets, reducing manual intervention by 60% and enabling rapid resolution for critical issues.

### **24. Blockchain Use Cases for Advanced Operations**

#### **Decentralized Identity Management**
1. **Adopting DID Standards**:
   - Use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for secure, user-controlled authentication processes. DIDs eliminate dependency on centralized servers, enhancing data privacy and control.
     ```solidity
     pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

     contract DecentralizedID {
         mapping(address => string) public identities;

         function registerID(string memory did) public {
             identities[msg.sender] = did;
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Example**: Enterprise-level systems use DIDs to manage internal credentials for employees and contractors across multinational divisions.

2. **SSI Ecosystem Development**:
   - Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) frameworks enable individuals to control their identities securely. SSI adoption enhances GDPR compliance through data minimization and privacy-by-design principles.

#### **Smart Contract-Based Automation**
